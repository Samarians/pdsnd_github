### Update Note
Dear my next mentor!
I have submitted project and got feedback that my commit message style 
is not followed Udacity guide completely. 
So I will make a few changes to meet the specifications. 
I will make one commit message in each branch to README file only, 
then merge the branch again.
The first one is this update note and I will commit it to master branch.

The second one will be committed in documentation branch. 

The third one will be committed in Refactoring branch.
